# NFC Bridge Server Requirements
# Install one of these NFC libraries based on your reader:

# Option 1: nfcpy (recommended for most USB NFC readers)
# nfcpy>=0.13.5

# Option 2: python-nfc (requires libnfc)
# python-nfc>=0.13.4

# Note: You may need to install system dependencies first:
# - For nfcpy: pip install nfcpy
# - For python-nfc: Install libnfc first, then pip install python-nfc

# For Windows with ACR122U readers, you might need:
# pip install pyscard

# For testing without hardware, you can use a mock mode
# (see nfc_server_simple.py for a version that works without NFC hardware)
